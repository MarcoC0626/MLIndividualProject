# MLIndividualProject

This is my individual project for user research using machine learning to analyze Amazon product reviews.
The two excel files are resultant files to demonstrate the output of the program.

To use, simply download the ML python file in run it through PyCharm in Anaconda.
Also, have the Amazon product page URL ready. Do NOT use any URL shrinking or delete any part of the URL.

The results of the analysis will be downloaded to a excel file named "Analysis". The file should be in the same directory as your program. Please check after the process has finished.
